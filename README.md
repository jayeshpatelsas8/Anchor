A privacy-focused Android application that enables you to locate and control your lost or stolen device remotely via SMS commands. No internet required, no servers involved - just direct SMS communication between your devices.

## Purpose

Anchor provides comprehensive remote control of your Android device through secure SMS commands, helping you recover lost or stolen devices:

- **Device Location**: Get precise GPS coordinates with Google Maps link
- **Remote Ring**: Make your device ring at maximum volume, even when silenced
- **Device Status**: Check battery level, charging status, and screen state
- **Call Back**: Make your device call you immediately
- **Sound Control**: Remotely change device sound mode (Normal/Vibrate/Silent)
- **Service Check**: Verify the tracking service is active

### Use Cases
- Locate lost device using GPS coordinates
- Ring device to find it nearby
- Get device status when lost
- Make device call you back
- Control device remotely when stolen
- Track device location for recovery

The app operates completely offline using SMS, providing:
- **No Internet Required**: Works via cellular SMS
- **No Data Collection**: All operations are local
- **Privacy-First**: No servers, no tracking, no analytics
- **Secure**: Password protection and phone whitelist

## Features
